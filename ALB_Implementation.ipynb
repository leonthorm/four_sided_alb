    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) Minimize the number of station sides activated and penalize their activation using weights μ1 and μ2.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) Minimize the total cost of using agents C(a) (humans or robots).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Contraints\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) Each task j must be assigned to exactly one mated-station m and one side h.\n",
    "\n",
    "(4) Tasks that are performed on beneath-side stations (set us) must be assigned to one station from the set MU (mated stations with beneath-side infrastructure).\n",
    "\n",
    "(5) Tasks that are performed on above-side stations (set ps) must be assigned to one station from the set MP (mated stations with above-side infrastructure).\n",
    "\n",
    "(6) An agent a can only be assigned to one station and side at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "(7) Humans are only assigned to the established station: A side h in station m can only be activated if an agent a is assigned to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "(8) No agents from the subset o(a) are assigned to side 4 (above-side) in any station m.\n",
    "o(a): Refers to a subset of agents, presumably humans, as tasks on the above-side (side 4) are meant to be performed exclusively by robots.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraint (9) and (10) define the cycle time which each task must be finished during the cycle time:**\n",
    "\n",
    "(9) The finishing time of task j for product model n must not exceed the cycle time cy.\n",
    "\n",
    "(10) The finishing time of task j for product model n must be greater than or equal to its real processing time r.\n",
    "\n",
    "(11) Calculates the real processing time for each task j and model n, accounting for the agent performing it, the station, and the side.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraints (12) and (13) are for tasks that include in pi(j) (Set of immediate predecessors of task j)**\n",
    "\n",
    "(12) 2 tasks have different mated-station: If task i is a predecessor of task j, task i must be assigned to a station earlier (or the same station as) task j.\n",
    "\n",
    "(13) 2 tasks are in the same mated-station: Task j starts only after its predecessor task i is completed. The ϕ-based terms deactivate this constraint when the tasks are not assigned to the same station-side configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraints (14) and (15) are for tasks which do not have any predecessor and successor relationships.**\n",
    "\n",
    "(14) The precedence relationship and timing between tasks j and k are respected, but the assignment of k to its station-side xkmh is directly required.\n",
    "\n",
    "(15) Timing relationship is reversed, i.e., task k must complete before task j starts, based on the sequence variable yjk, while maintaining strict enforcement on xkmh.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraints (16) and (17) calculate the number of different mated-stations which include one-sided mated-stations, two-sided mated-stations, three-sided mated-stations and four-sided mated-stations.**\n",
    "\n",
    "(16) Tasks j can only be assigned to a station-side if that side zmh is activated. (If zmh=0, this constraint ensures no tasks are assigned to that side).\n",
    "\n",
    "(17) Ensures consistency between the number of sides zmh utilized in a station m and the values of α,β,θ,γ (If zmh indicates one side is used, α=1, and β,θ,γ=0).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraints (18) and (19) define zoning constraints that include positive and negative constraint.**\n",
    "\n",
    "(18) More than one task is assigned to a station: Tasks j and i, which have a positive constraint (po), are assigned to the same side h.\n",
    "\n",
    "(19) Only one task is assigned to a station: Tasks j and i, which have a negative constraint (ne), are not assigned to the same side of station m.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraints (20) and (21) define the synchronous constraint which means if two tasks must be done together synchronously, they would be assigned to the same mated-station.**\n",
    "\n",
    "(20) Tasks j and i, which have a synchronous constraint (se), are assigned to different sides l≠h of the same station m.\n",
    "\n",
    "(21) Tasks j and i, which have a synchronous constraint (se), have synchronized finishing times across sides.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In constraints (22) and (24), if the task must be performed by a human, ensure that human is assigned to that station.** \n",
    "\n",
    "(22) vI,mh is activated if and only if at least one task in to (Set of tasks which humans perform) is assigned to station m, side h.\n",
    "\n",
    "(24) Prevents agents from the subset r(a) from being assigned to sides where tasks from to are assigned.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In constraints (23) and (25),if the task must be performed by a robot, ensure that the robot is assigned to that station.**\n",
